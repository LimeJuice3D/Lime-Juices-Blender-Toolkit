# Straight UVs Addon

UV editing tool for straightening outer UV edges.

## Features:
**Straighten UVs**
- Align outside edges of a UV to the X or Y axis.
- Inner verts can be smoothed using the Smooth Iterations property.

## Installation:
1. Download ZIP file
2. Extract straight_uvs.py
3. In blender > preferences > addons, select Install from Disk (top right dropdown) and select straight_uvs.py

This addon is currently untested and in-development, and as such the addon is feature-limited and prone to bugs.
In general, the addon will likely not be helpful for particularly abstract or thin UVs yet, due to how the
UV border detection algorithm works.
